use a document database for the serialized game object
use relational database for job information, or maybe flat files?
I could duplicate the information about jobs and items on the client so that I dont have to query anything


controller - api layer 
service - logic layer
data - database layer


TODO
Add api for player updates so that a player may only change their own data. Merging and validation will happen on the backend.
